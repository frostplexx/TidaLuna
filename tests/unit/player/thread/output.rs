//! Tests for the resampling and callback halves of `src/player/thread/output.rs`,
//! attached to it by `#[path]`.
//! `AudioPipeline` is `pub(super)` and `build_cpal_callback` is module-private; a child module
//! of `player::thread` reaches both without widening anything. Nothing here opens a device:
//! the pipeline is a pure function of its input, and the callback is a closure over rings.
//!
//! Every case that checks a shape also checks energy. A structural assertion cannot tell a
//! correct result from an empty one, and silence is what a broken resampler produces.
