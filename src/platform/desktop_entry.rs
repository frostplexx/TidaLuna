//! Linux: install a freedesktop `.desktop` entry plus an icon under
//! `~/.local/share/` for the WM to match a taskbar/dock icon for our window.
//!
//! GNOME Shell ignores `_NET_WM_ICON` and only resolves the icon through a
//! `.desktop` file matched by `WM_CLASS`; KDE and others use both. We always
//! write the entry: the user gets a real icon on every desktop.
//!
//! The entry also carries the `tidal://` association. Recording us as its
//! default handler is a separate job, `claim_scheme_default`, because a
//! packaged install ships the entry and still claims nothing.
//!
//! Idempotent: each call rewrites only when the on-disk content differs from
//! the current binary path or embedded icon.
