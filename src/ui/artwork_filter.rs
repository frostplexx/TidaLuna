//! Drop TIDAL's video album covers from JSON:API responses.
//!
//! The CEF binary we ship carries no H.264 decoder; Chromium's codec allowlist
//! refuses the `.mp4` artwork before a decoder is ever picked, and TIDAL answers
//! that failure with a near-blank placeholder rather than the cover it owns.
//!
//! Both artworks travel in the same compound document: `included` carries an
//! `IMAGE` resource next to the `VIDEO` one, and TIDAL already holds a selector
//! for each. Removing the video resource hands the choice back to code TIDAL
//! wrote, on data it sent, at every surface that shares the component rather
//! than at the one screen where the defect was noticed.
